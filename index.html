<div style="margin-bottom: 70px;">
<p>Hi I'm <a href="/about">Eric</a>, an independent <strong>freelance iOS app developer</strong> and consultant based in San Francisco, California. </p>

<p>I help mobile focused companies and startups take their ideas and turn them into amazing mobile apps that are both beautiful and easy to use.</p> 
<p>I've worked with companies to help create great products for over 10 years. Since 2012 I've been building mobile apps (featured in the App Store) at startups which have collectively grown to many hundreds of thousands of active users. I have also designed, created, and published a number of my own apps. <strong>If you need an iOS developer, then I'm probably what you're looking for</strong>.</p>

<p>Have a project for me? Take a look at a few examples of my work below and then <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>. I am <strong>currently available from August 2018</strong>.
</p>

<h2 style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;">Oldio - Audiobook Classics</h2>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495?mt=8&at=1000lNpk&ct=website">Oldio</a> is an app that makes it easy to listen to thousands of free classic audiobooks whenever and wherever you are.</p>
<p>I independently built Oldio in early 2018 as my first self-published app. I wanted an audiobook player with simple but powerful interface which was also free of ads, and that allowed you to stream or download audiobooks for offline playback. The app also includes some fun features like shake to reset sleep timer, and auto adjusting theme based on screen brightness.</p>

<p>As the sole mobile developer at Proven I was responsible for both the design and development of this app. It was a complete re-write of the Job Search app previously built for applying to jobs on Craigslist back in 2012.

<h2 style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;">Job Search</h2>
<p>Job Search was the first app that let mobile users easily apply to jobs on Craigslist with their full resume. </p>

<p>At the time the app was launched the process of attaching a resume with a job application was rather cumbersome from a mobile device. To improve this process the app featured a built-in resume builder, flexible file importing & syncing, and an easy to use job search interface.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies:</strong></br>Objective-C, Core Data, SQLite, Core Location, Dropbox SDK, AddressBook</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately this app is no longer available from the App Store. I've left it here purely out of nostalgia for my first published app way back in 2012!</em></p>
